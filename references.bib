    abstract = "{Calibration directly to population control totals, bypassing any explicit nonresponse adjustments, is one option for correcting for nonresponse bias. Poststratification, raking, and general regression estimation are alternative methods for single-step nonresponse adjustment through calibration. The models that underlie the response mechanism and the structure of outcome variables collected in a survey both affect the efficacy of these estimators. Consistent with earlier literature, we demonstrate that the model for the outcome variables is most important in determining bias, standard errors, and confidence interval coverage. However, if the predictive power of the model for an outcome variable is weak, properties of the aforementioned estimators of totals will be very similar.}",

    abstract = "{Imputed values in surveys are often generated under the assumption that the sampling mechanism is non-informative (or ignorable) and the study variable is missing at random (MAR). When the sampling design is informative, the assumption of MAR in the population does not necessarily imply MAR in the sample. In this case, the classical method of imputation using a model fitted to the sample data does not in general lead to unbiased estimation. To overcome this problem, we consider alternative approaches to imputation assuming MAR in the population. We compare the alternative imputation procedures through simulation and an application to estimation of mean erosion using data from the Conservation Effects Assessment Project.}",

    abstract = "{Propensity-score adjustment is a popular technique for handling unit nonresponse in sample surveys. If the response probability depends on the study variable that is subject to missingness, estimating the response probability often relies on additional distributional assumptions about the study variable. Instead of making fully parametric assumptions about the population distribution of the study variable and the response mechanism, we propose a new approach of maximum likelihood estimation that is based on the distributional assumptions of the observed part of the sample. Because the model for the observed part of the sample can be verified from the data, the proposed method is less sensitive to failure of the assumed model of the outcomes. Results from two limited simulation studies are presented to compare the performance of the proposed method with the existing methods. The proposed method is applied to the exit poll data for the nineteenth legislative election in Korea.}",

 abstract = {Post stratification is usually judged in the context of the variance of the post stratification estimator taken over all possible sample configurations appropriately weighted by the probability of occurrence. The generally accepted view is that, in most cases, the technique has little to offer over using the sample mean. This basis for evaluating the technique is questioned and the appropriate framework for statistical inference discussed. It is argued that inferences should be made conditional on the achieved sample configuration. The theory developed shows that neither the post stratification estimator nor the sample mean is uniformly best in all situations but empirical investigations indicate that post stratification offers protection against unfavourable sample configurations and should be viewed as a robust technique.},

abstract = { We propose the name generalized raking for the class of procedures developed in this article, because the classical raking ratio of W. E. Deming is a special case. Generalized raking can be used for estimation in surveys with auxiliary information in the form of known marginal counts in a frequency table in two or more dimensions. An important property of the generalized raking weights is that they reproduce the known marginal counts when applied to the categorical variables that define the frequency table. Our starting point is a class of distance measures and a set of original weights in the form of the standard sampling weights 1/π

k
, where π

k
 is the inclusion probability of element k. New weights are derived by minimizing the total distance between original weights and new weights. The article makes contributions in three areas: (1) statistical inference conditionally on estimated cell counts, (2) simple calculation of variance estimates for the generalized raking estimators, and (3) presentation of the new computer software CALMAR. Our conditional approach highlights the role played by interaction between the factors that define the frequency table. Absence of interaction implies that generalized raking is as efficient as complete post-stratification. The variance estimates we propose are calculated with the aid of the residuals from the fit of an additive analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The CALMAR software, recently developed at I.N.S.E.E., is now used in various national surveys for calculating generalized raking weights. We illustrate its use with the aid of data from the 1990 survey of living conditions in France. In this application a table in seven dimensions with known marginal counts is used for generalized raking. }
